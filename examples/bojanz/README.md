```
Currency symbols are supposed to be locale specific.

The symbol for a dollar is $ in en-US, $US in fr, US$ in en-AU and many others.
There is also other locale-specific data that you need in order to represent a currency amount 
(indicating whether the symbol goes before/after the amount, 
the spacing used, the size of the number groups, the used grouping symbols).

This is especially important for EUR amounts, cause every EU country formats them differently.

I received this feedback from bojanz on reddit, so I will name the example after them.
